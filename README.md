# SnowBoarder
Code along implementation of the SnowBoarder project from [GameDev.tv's][1] [Unity 2D Course][2]

## Setup

### Required software:
1. [Unity][3]
2. A text editor, like [VS Code][4], for editing scripts.

## Running
For now, we are just running the game from within Unity, using the [Game view][5].

## Testing
No testing at this time; following a tutorial, we may not get to it. If this was an actual project, you bet there would be tests.
